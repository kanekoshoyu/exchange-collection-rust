 * Hyperliquid API

 * Documentation for the Hyperliquid public API     ## **Rate limits** The following rate limits apply per IP address:   - All REST requests have a weight limit of 1200 per minute. All documented exchange API requests have a weight of 1. All documented info API requests have a weight of either 2 or 20; these limits can be found in the description for each info request in the Info endpoint section. All explorer API requests have a weight of 40.   - Maximum of 100 websocket connections   - Maximum of 1000 websocket subscriptions   - Maximum of 10 unique users across user-specific websocket subscriptions  - Maximum of 2000 inbound messages per minute across all websocket connections   - Use websockets for lowest latency realtime data. See the python SDK for a full-featured example.    ## **Address-based L1 Rate limits**    The L1 rate limiting logic will allow 1 requests per 1 USDC traded cumulatively since address inception.   Using an order value of 100 USDC, this only requires a fill rate of 1%.    Each address starts with an initial buffer of 10000 requests. When rate limited, an address will still be allowed one request every 10 seconds.  Cancels have cumulative limit min(limit + 100000, limit * 2) where limit is the default limit for other actions. This way, hitting the address-based rate limit will still allow open orders to be canceled.   Note that this rate limit only applies to L1 actions, not info requests.   ## **Batched Requests** A batched request with n orders (or cancels) is treated as one request for IP based rate limiting, but as n requests for address-based L1 rate limiting.
